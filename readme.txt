TOAK Readme

TOAK is a tool for visualization and analysis of EMA-based datasets.
In its current form, it works well with the EMA-MAE data set from 
Ji, Johnson, and Berry created at Marquette University.

The program runs using visualizationTool.py, which is the main window
for the program.  The code is well-commented and contains a description
of each of the components at the top of each file.

In its current form, the sensorDataView class does not fit well into the 
main window, but this will be fixed shortly.  Generally, the program
works well for visualization and basic analysis of articulatory
kinematics.
